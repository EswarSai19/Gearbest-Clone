My name is Eswar Sai I am goig to explain about my first team project Experience.
I worked on the Super deals page and product page. Tried to clone as near as possible, for this cloning i have used 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
On this journey I have learned more about CSS types of properties and hovering each elememnts in similar way, 
in javascript part I tried to clone all product details by using functions and also improved my HTML & CSS, I like 
working as a team, interact with each other professionally.
I feel like I gained so much knowledge about creating webpages and also learned interacting and experiencing the struggles may improve our 
problem solving skills. I gave my best and did a lot of things but still, there are a few functionally things that are left behind and remain static .
